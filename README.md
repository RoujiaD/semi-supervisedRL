CartPole
=======================
>Cartpole is a classic control game from OpenAI Gym, and the goal of the game is to prevent the pendulum from both falling over and >moving away from center. The action player can take is to push the cart to either left or right with a fixed force, and the state the >cartpole has is the position and acceleration of both cart and pole. The game is considered terminal once the pole is more than 12 >degrees from vertical, or once the cart moves more than 2.4 units from the center. [Source]
